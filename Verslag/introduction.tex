\section{Introduction}

From quantum effects to pendulums and from data exchange to clocks, there are many phenomena and devices that are governed by harmonic oscillators. Since harmonic oscillators can be used to describe any system with a smooth potential near a stable equilibrium and many corresponding applications, it is a popular topic in physics. The harmonic oscillator is defined as a system in subject to a restoring force that is proportional to the displacement from an equilibrium position. As a result of this restoring force, harmonic oscillators will describe an oscillatory motion. \\
In this experiment, the motion of a pendulum subject to a driving force, will be studied. The restoring force of the pendulum is gravity which exerts a force in the vertical direction. A pendulum will in real-life also be subject to a friction exerting a force in the opposite direction of the motion. For this experiment, however, the hypothetical situation of no friction and 'negative' friction will also be studied.
